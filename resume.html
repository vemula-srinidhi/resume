            <p>The project aims to differentiate between healthy and diseased potato leaves using a CNN architecture. Our
                developed application detects leaf conditions and suggests appropriate fertilizers if a disease is detected. This
                web application offers comprehensive information about potato crop production and GDP crop rates. It was built
                using the Flask framework, deep learning techniques, and Python in PyCharm.</p>
